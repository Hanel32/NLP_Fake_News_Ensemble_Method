Things to do:
- Transfer pos/neg in the perceptron to being real/fake.
  - To do this, need to put real and fake news in separate folders akin to pos/neg and change file path
  
  
Things done:
- Moved removal of stopwords to when the trainsplits are being made. It's being put into four different locations;
  would probably suffice to simply move it to one of the two trainsplit functions, but which?

- Added weight lists for bigrams and trigrams
  - Note: There will be 2x as many bigrams as unigrams, and 3x as many trigrams.
          It's my hope that removing stopwords before training will allow for a much closer fit/smaller data.
- Added size initialization for bigram and trigram vectors
